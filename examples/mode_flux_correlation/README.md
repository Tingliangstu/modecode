# Simple mode flux example.

This directory houses a workflow example for calculating the ensemble average of the time-integral of the mode flux correlation.

    chmod +x run_ensembles.sh
    ./run_ensembles.sh > output

See the simulation outputs (jnm.dat files) in jnm_house, which houses Jnm(t) for the simulation.

*Units of mode flux are in (g/mol)A^2/ps*
