# Verifying spatial vibrational energy transfer.

This is a simple example of spatial vibrational energy transfer - a Si-Ge superlattice with the Si side transferring energy to the Ge side. We calculate the actual energy of the Ge side during an MD simulation, and then compare this energy to the time-integrated expression for spatial vibrational energy transfer. The results agree nearly perfectly.
