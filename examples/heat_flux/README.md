# Simulating mode-mode contributions to heat flux.

These examples show how to calculate the coupling constants arising from transforming the heat flux operator to mode coordinates. These are like the "generalized velocities" in the quasi-harmonic Green-Kubo theory. 

The eigenvector (EMAT) and generalized velocity (GV) files associated with these examples are on dropbox:
