# Heat flux example with pure Si.

This example starts from the beginning, by (1) obtaining the material structure, (2) running MD to ensure that the structure is stable, (3) performing mode calculations with ModeCode to get the modes, and (4) running MD again and simulating the heat flux. Follow the order of files here for each step.

EMAT and GV should go in this directory.
