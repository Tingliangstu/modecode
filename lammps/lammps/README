Put these files into the /src directory of LAMMPS and then install LAMMPS.

There are 2 classes here: (1) compute mode
                          (2) fix mode

************************************ Compute Mode **************************************************
Compute mode computes and outputs mode amplitudes, velocities, temperature, and energies. In LAMMPS, 
it's used like so:

  compute modeComp all mode 0 # Setting value: 0 - plots, 1 - gifs, 2 - plots and gifs.

where the final integer is an output setting that determines whether to output data for plots or
gifs.

For a setting of 0, data for plots are output where the first column represents the time, and 
the other columns represent the mode indices (starting from zero) for which a quantity (amplitude,
velocity, energy, etc.) is being output. 

For a setting of 1, data for gifs are output where the x-axis of the gif are mode frequencies, and
y-axis are whatever quantity you want to view as a function of time. This option allows one to view
all mode quantities as a function of time.

For a setting of 2, both plot and gif data are output. 

If you use setting 0 or 2, you must supply an INDICES file which labels the mode indices (starting
from zero) that you wish you output data for. 

************************************ Fix Mode **************************************************
Fix mode sets the initial mode temperatures and coordinates. 

These are set via the MODETEMP and MODECOOR files. For any modes that are not found in these files,
they'll be given a value of zero.
