# Verifying the mode power transfer expression.

To run this example, simply execute the `run.sh` bash script. This runs a MD simulation and then calculates the power transfer from mode #10 (index starts at zero) to all other modes. This power transfer is time-integrated, and then compared to the actual energy of mode #10. The two quantities agree nearly perfectly.
